Hey folks. im a person who loves breaking things - mostly digital things. Im always curious about how things work, and the best way to find out is by messing with them.

Right now, im interested in malware and doing CTFs at the same time. Working towards becoming a Red Teamer one day.

Feel free to check out the posts I've made for learning something new.
